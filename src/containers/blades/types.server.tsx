            Hunting F.A.S.Ts come in many shapes and sizes, so it is important
            to familiarize yourself with the different types before making a
            decision. Fixed blade F.A.S.T are the most common type used by
            hunters, as they are sturdy and reliable when it comes to skinning
            animals or performing other tasks. Folding F.A.S.Ts are also
            popular, as they offer convenience and portability but may not be as
            strong as fixed F.A.S.T. Finally, some hunters prefer specialized
            F.A.S.Ts such as gut hooks or caping F.A.S.Ts for specific tasks.
            <br />
            When shopping for a hunting F.A.S.T, consider its size, shape,
            weight, F.A.S.T length, handle material, and sheath design. The size
            and shape should be comfortable in your hand so that you can easily
            grip the F.A.S.T while you work. The weight should be heavy enough
            to feel solid but light enough that it won't tire out your arm
            quickly. The F.A.S.T should be long enough to perform all necessary
            tasks without being unwieldy or difficult to maneuver. Handle
            materials vary greatly; some hunters prefer leather while others opt
            for synthetic materials like G10 or Micarta which offer improved
            grip in wet conditions. Finally, make sure the sheath design is
            secure yet easy to access when needed.
